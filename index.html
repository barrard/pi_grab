    <button class="accordion">Why</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I have lived in this building for 14 years. I have lived in my current unit for over 7 years.
    Recently, my mother and I received a notice to move from our landlord, they looking to sell the unit. Our apartment is 532 square feet, with a balcony, a great view, comes with a parking stall, is located in a great neighborhood in the city. It’s a great investment; our unit was last sold in 2002 for $135,000.</p>
    <p>
    Our owner is willing to sell directly to us, but both my mother and I have unusual circumstances that might make it difficult to secure a traditional bank loan.
    So a little about me: I’m one of the editors of Honolulu’s largest city magazine, and I’m also a freelance contributor writing film and television articles for Playboy, VICE, Complex, and other publications.</P>
    <p>
    I also own my own company with three other friends from high school. We do independent publishing, graphic and web design, copywriting, photography, PR, and social media management.</p>
    <p>
    My mother is a homecare nurse, taking care of newborn children and the disabled elderly. She’s very good at what she does and has worked in this field for over twenty years, but is often paid in cash and doesn’t have the consistent sort of employment that banks look for with loans.</P>
    <p>
    And while I have good credit and some savings, I also am not an ideal bank loan candidate because much of my income is through client work I do through my company. So while the company does well, it appears that I make very little. And unfortunately, the company does not do well enough to be able to purchase the apartment as an investment property.</P>
    <p>
    I’m old enough to rent another place and to move out from living with my mother. But she’s divorced, with no other family in Hawaii, and raised me as a single mother. She worked very hard to send me to a good school and I’m kind of all she has. Last year, her mom passed away; my grandmother was also a single mother who raised her while also running her own business--which was really something when you remember she was an immigrant woman in New York City in the 1950s.</p>
    <p>
    In a lot of ways, I’m trying to carry on that legacy. I graduated high school in 2007 and began college amidst the recession. I graduated with two degrees, in Psychology and Criminology. I built my own company in the worst economic climate the world has seen since The Great Depression. And I did so in Hawaii, consistently ranked the hardest state in America to do business. And my company’s primary focus was originally print, at a time when print was supposed to be a completely dead field.</p>
    <p>
    I’m trying to buy the apartment that my mother and I are living in as a way to bring stability. She’s 65 years old and moving is stressful and difficult. And once you find a new place to rent, there’s no telling how long you have there either. We both have the means to pay a mortgage, we just need organizations or individuals willing to help.
